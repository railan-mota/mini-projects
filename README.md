# About

In this project, I focus primarily on the visual aspect. It consists of 4 UI mini-projects:

- Email Subscribe
- Pricing Grid
- Product
- Login

## Tech

- NextJS
- Typescript
- Tailwind

They're not wired up, hence they don't have any function other than show data in a nice way.

So far each one of them isn't a reusable component, and all data were hard coded.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
